<h1>🔍 Predictive Customer Churn: A Data Science Project</h1>

<h3>📄 Project Overview</h3>

The "Predictive Customer Churn" project focuses on solving a crucial business challenge: retaining customers. Customer churn, or the percentage of customers discontinuing a product/service, can greatly impact profitability.

This project builds a machine learning-based solution to predict whether a customer is likely to churn, enabling proactive retention strategies. The solution was developed using a systematic approach, including problem understanding, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and selection of the best-performing model.

<h3>❓ Problem Statement</h3>

Losing customers is costly for businesses 🏢. The challenge lies in identifying which customers are likely to churn and why.

This project addresses the classification problem of predicting customer churn, categorizing customers into "churn" or "non-churn" classes. By doing so, businesses can take targeted actions to improve customer retention rates 📈.

<h3>🎯 Objective</h3>

The objectives of the project are:

🔍 Identify the key factors contributing to customer churn.

🛠️ Preprocess and analyze data to ensure it’s clean and ready for modeling.

🤖 Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models to predict churn.

⚙️ Optimize the best model using advanced hyperparameter tuning techniques, like Bayesian optimization with Optuna.

💡 Provide insights and actionable recommendations to minimize churn rates.
